      <p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Tips for searching the EYQL
      </h2>

      <p>
        If you cannot find a qualification that you think should appear on the EYQL, try:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>checking your spelling</li>
          <li>using fewer words from the qualification title</li>
          <li>checking the qualification name and awarding organisation with the candidate</li>
          <li>asking the candidate to provide a copy of their certificate</li>
          <li>adding or removing filters on the search page</a>
        </ul>
      </p>



      <p>
        This qualification is approved by the Department for Education (DfE) as full and relevant, if:

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>The qualification was started after 1 September 2014.</li>
          <li>The qualification certificate shows Early Years Educator in the qualification name. Where the qualification certificate shows Knowledge only pathway the holder cannot count in the ratios.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <div class="govuk-warning-text">
        <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
        <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
          <span class="govuk-visually-hidden">Warning</span>
          You must make sure that the qualification name exactly matches the qualification on the certificate, including any wording in brackets.
        </strong>
      </div>

      <p>
        Someone who holds this qualification can be included in staff to child ratios at level 3 as long as they meet all the other level 3 requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
        Other requirements to work in the staff to child ratios at level 3
      </h2>

      <p>
        For someone who holds this qualification to be included in the staff to child ratios at level 3, they must:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>hold a suitable level 2 English qualification, as specified in the <a href="#">early years qualification requirements and standards document</a></li>
        <li>hold a current paediatric first aid qualification which meets the criteria in the <a href="#">early years foundation stage (EYFS) statutory framework</a></li>
        <li>meet all other requirements as set out in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2" class="govuk-link">EYFS</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-qualification-requirements-and-standards" class="govuk-link">early years qualification requirements and standards document</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A person who holds a full and relevant level 3 qualification started after September 2014, but who does not hold a suitable level 2 qualification in English can be counted in the staff to child ratios at level 2.
