        NCFE CACHE Level 3 Diploma in Childcare and Education (Early Years Educator)
      </h2>

      <p>
        The above qualification is listed as being full and relevant on the Early Years Qualifications List (EYQL). As such, you can be counted in the Level 3 staff:child ratios in an early years setting in England, as defined by the Department for Education.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As the qualification was completed after 1 September 2014, please note that to count in the staff:child ratios at Level 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">as outlined in the Early Years Foundation Stage</a>, you must also have achieved suitable Level 2 qualifications in English and Maths. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you do not have suitable Level 2 qualifications in English and maths, you can only count in the ratios at Level 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that entrants to the early years workforce are required to hold either a full paediatric first aid (PFA) or an emergency PFA certificate, within three months of starting work to be counted in the Level 3 staff:child ratios. For further information on Paediatric First Aid courses, please refer to the Health and Safety Executive.
