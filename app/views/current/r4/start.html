        <li>check if an early years qualification is approved by the Department for Education (DfE) as full and relevant</li>

      <!-- <div class="govuk-inset-text"> -->
        <p>To be approved as full and relevant, the qualification name and awarding organisation must exactly match the entry on the early years qualifications list (EYQL), including any wording in brackets.</p>
        <p>There may be additional requirements which need to be met for a qualification to be considered full and relevant. This service will advise you if any additional requirements apply, and what these are.</p>
