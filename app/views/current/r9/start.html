      <p>Use this service to:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>check if an early years qualification is approved by the Department for Education (DfE) as full and relevant</li>
        <li>confirm if someone who holds this qualification can count in staff to child ratios at level 2, 3 or 6</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>
        To confirm if the qualification is full and relevant, this service will ask you about:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>if the qualification was awarded in the UK or overseas</li>
        <li>the level of the qualification</li>
        <li>the date that the qualification was started</li>
        <li>the awarding organisation</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some qualifications have additional requirements which need to be met for the qualification to be considered full and relevant. This service will tell you if any additional requirements apply, and what these are.
