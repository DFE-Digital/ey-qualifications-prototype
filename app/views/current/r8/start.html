        To confirm if the qualification is full and relevant, this service will ask you about:
      </p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the country where the qualification was awarded</li>
        <li>the level of the qualification</li>

        <li>the awarding organisation</li>

      <p>
        Some qualifications have additional requirements which need to be met for the qualification to be considered full and relevant. This service will tell you if any additional requirements apply, and what these are.
