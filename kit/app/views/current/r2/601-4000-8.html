      <p>
        NCFE CACHE Level 3 Diploma in Childcare and Education (Early Years Educator) is listed as being full and relevant on the Early Years Qualifications List (EYQL). As such, you can be counted in the Level 3 staff:child ratios in an early years setting in England, as defined by the Department for Education.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the qualification was completed after 1 September 2014, please note that to count in the staff:child ratios at Level 3 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2">as outlined in the Early Years Foundation Stage</a>, you must also have achieved suitable Level 2 qualifications in English and Maths.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you do not have suitable Level 2 qualifications in English and maths, you can only count in the ratios at Level 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please note that entrants to the early years workforce are required to hold either a full paediatric first aid (PFA) or an emergency PFA certificate, within three months of starting work to be counted in the Level 3 staff:child ratios. For further information on Paediatric First Aid courses, please refer to the Health and Safety Executive.
